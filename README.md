#Patterns

Patterns is a space to create, share, and admire abstract art inspired by fractal patterns found in nature. Begin with a tree on your canvas, and watch it transform into surprising and unexpected shapes with the movement of your mouse. Save your masterpieces to a public art gallery, and while youâ€™re there, be sure to take a look around.

Technology Stack: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, AWS S3 API
